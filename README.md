# Textpattern tem theme

This theme is built fpr the Textpattern CMS [Textpattern CMS](https://textpattern.com/). It is a very simple theme built on the Textpattern Zero (empty) install, designed to promote collaborative, project-based relational learning but could be used for other purposes. It seeks to interlink user content (articles) through key words, related articles, categories, the search function, and links to author pages listing an author's articles. The homepage displays the titles of, excerpts from, and links to important content. Important content could include a mission statement and any important messages, and is followed by feature articles. The category list and search bar are always visible on all pages.

## Features
1. Beginner friendly - the theme could also be used as a simple illustration of a readymade textpattern site for non-programmers who are interested in tailor making their own simple sites. This could be of use in IndieWeb selfdogfooding.
2. Anti-bloat. Style inspiration taken from bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com. 
3. Eco-friendly: the theme scores in the 98th percentile on the Website Carbon Calculator.
4. No external images used, but code indicates where theme users should place their own images (cf. "icon").
5. Sustainable. Written only in HTML, CSS, and Textpattern PHP. 

### Important note
This theme was written by a beginner who did not want to task programmers with such a simple design. Constructive criticism is welcome.
